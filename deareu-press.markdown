## Dear Europe
Dear Europe is a collaborative video about the upcoming European elections and how lessons from Brexit and Trump, might relate. The piece was made by artists who call the US and the UK home. To better reach our audience, we translated the video in Dutch, French and German.

Our hope was to impress upon our friends in Europe that the future is writen by those who vote.

## **WHY (CONTINUED)**
“My hope is the video will remind people how connected we are. Clicking retweet or share won’t save the world. But I think, as people who work in art and communication, we can urge caution, encourage dialogue and promote engagement. When Brexit happened, I wondered aloud how much a canary that vote was for our own election. In retrospect, I wish we could have heeded that event as more of a warning. If anything, I hope people in the US and around the world pay attention to global politics and consider a zoomed out perspective. There are many personal bubbles we should strive to bust. When I started reaching out to designers about participating in this video, I was pleasantly surprised how many also felt the need to do or say *something*. The collaborative nature of this project only underscores our collective message.”<br/>

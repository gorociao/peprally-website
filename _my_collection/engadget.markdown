AOL’s tech hub, Engadget, wasn’t just looking for an a broadcast packaging overhaul, they also needed a modular design system that could expand to fit their growing lineup of shows. Work shown here is the heart of that re-design, which also included a versionable kit chock full of lower thirds, mortises and paired down bumpers.

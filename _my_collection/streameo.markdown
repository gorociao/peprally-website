## **Vimeo: Streameo Openining Titles**
How does IBM’s design ethos extend beyond pixels and into IRL? We were tasked to make a film that answered this question and be inducted into company’s [Design Language series](https://www.ibm.com/design/workplace/).

It's hard to say where the field of motion design would be without Justin Cone and Motionographer.

Together with good friends and neighbors, Slanted Studios, we flexed our character muscles and captured the artistic diversity that defines our field.

VoteGif was a self-initated project that became widely retweeted and shared by all kinds of online communities: celebrities, politicians, brands, activists, moms and millenials. After launching, Hillary Clintonâ€™s team asked if they could incorporate the gifs into their own GOTV products, like the chrome app, picture above. We were thrilled!

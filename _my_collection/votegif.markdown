## VoteGif.com (and VotarGif.com)
Ultra-shareable gifs to encourage Americans to register to vote in time for the 2016 election. 

VoteGif was a self-initated project that became widely retweeted and shared by all kinds of online communities: celebrities, politicians, brands, activists, moms and millenials. After launching, Hillary Clintonâ€™s team asked if they could incorporate the gifs into their own GOTV products, like the chrome app, picture above. We were thrilled!

It's hard to say where the field of motion design would have been without Justin Cone and motionographer. So when he asked us to help celebrate a decade of design coverage and annouce the site's next phase, saying yes was a no-brainer. Together with good friends and neighbors, Slanted Studios, we flexed our character muscles and captured the artistic diversity that defines our field.

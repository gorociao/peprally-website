It's hard to say where the field of motion design would be without Justin Cone and Motionographer. So when he asked us to make a video that celebrated a decade of design coverage, saying yes was a no-brainer. Together with good friends and neighbors, Slanted Studios, we flexed our character muscles and captured the artistic diversity that defines our field.

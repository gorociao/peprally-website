## Yule Log: â€˜Lil Bellows Blaze

Now a holiday tradition, [Yule Log 2.0](http://www.watchyulelog.com/) invites select members of the design and animation community to re-interpret the famed WPIX-11 hearth. The project was started and organized by Daniel Savage and Wondersauce. 

Co-Animation: Seth Eckert
